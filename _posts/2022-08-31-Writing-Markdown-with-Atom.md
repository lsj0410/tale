When I first began writing posts on this blog, I simply created a new Markdown file in my 'posts' folder and began writing. Pretty soon I realized that this was beyond inconvenient. I could not save my post in the progress of writing it(which meant I had to be very much prepared before writing), and switching back and forth from the preview tab was also time consuming.

## Atom

While contemplating a different solution I realized that [Atom](https://atom.io/) was pretty likely to be a good answer. I had often used Atom to write code, and it did support Markdown. After a minute of Googling I discovered the Atom plugin [markdown-preview-enhanced](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-enhanced), which proved to be a wonderful asset to writing in Markdown.

## markdown-preview-enhanced

To install a package in atom, navigate to 'File'-'Settings' and move to the 'Install' tab. Search for the desired package and click 'install'. Then return to your Markdown file and press `ctrl+shift+m`(an alternative is clicking on 'Packages'-'Markdown Preview'-'Toggle Preview' on the menu bar). Then you have a real-time preview page on the right.

`markdown-preview-enhanced` has several advantages to the default Markdown preview Atom provides. For me the greatest merit was that it rendered math in `MathJax`. Another convenient function is the Image Helper. Navigate to the command palette with `ctrl+shift+p` and type 'image helper'. Simply drag your local image to the 'Upload' box and the Image Helper generates a url. This makes the tedious process of inserting images in Markdown a lot easier. Some other features of markdown-preview-enhanced include synchronized scrolling between your markdown file and the preview, running code chunks, and TOC(Table of Contents) generation.
